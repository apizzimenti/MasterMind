####The MasterMind Game
There are very few instructions. Installation is a hassle, so here's how it works:

1. Download the .zip from GitHub here, off to the right
2. Extract the files, and move the inner folder (should be called "MasterMind-Game-master") to the Desktop or wherever you see fit; move it anywhere
not inside the current folder.
3. Run the .jar file.
4. Have minimal amounts of fun.
